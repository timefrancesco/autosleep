autosleep
=========

A simple tool to put PC to sleep after x mins

It doesn't do much, it just put the pc to sleep if there were no inputs after the set number of minutes.

I've written it because I am not able to set up Win 8.1 to go to sleep automatically, it took less time to write this program than figure out why Windows Sleep doesn't work (and trust me, I've tried everything!).
